# **Designing Effective Leaderboards — UX Guidelines**

A well-designed leaderboard motivates users, reinforces progress, and strengthens product engagement. Poorly designed ones can intimidate, confuse, or demotivate.
These guidelines capture the essential UX principles for designing leaderboards that are fair, motivating, and psychologically safe.

---

## **1. Balance Competition With Psychological Safety**

Leaderboards work best when competition feels attainable, not punishing.

* Use **tiers** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) instead of one long list.
* Display players close to the user’s rank, not the entire population.
* Avoid large, demoralizing point gaps by grouping similar users together.

---

## **2. Always Show the User’s Own Position**

Users must instantly understand *where they stand*.

* Pin the user’s position even if they are far down the list.
* Highlight with color or emphasis.
* Show movement indicators (e.g., ↑ 2 places today).

---

## **3. Keep Scoring Logic Transparent**

Users only try to climb when they understand how the system works.

* Provide a clear, simple explanation of how points are earned.
* Use tooltips or inline hints for score calculations.
* Avoid hidden rules or exceptions—they erode trust.

---

## **4. Apply Time-Bound Leaderboard Resets**

Static leaderboards kill motivation for newcomers.

* Use daily, weekly, monthly, or seasonal cycles.
* Announce resets clearly.
* Give everyone a recurring fresh start.

---

## **5. Protect Fairness Through Anti-Cheat Design**

Leaderboards must feel credible and protected.

* Display update timestamps.
* Flag suspicious jumps in ranking.
* Validate scores server-side to avoid manipulation.

---

## **6. Support Different Player Types**

A leaderboard should be motivating for top, middle, and low performers.

* **Top performers:** feature a top-10 section.
* **Middle performers:** show peers with similar points.
* **Low performers:** offer personal goals, milestones, streaks, and badges.

---

## **7. Provide Micro-Feedback Loops**

Rank alone is not enough to sustain engagement.

* Include streaks, achievements, progress arcs.
* Celebrate personal bests.
* Provide quick wins between major rank changes.

---

## **8. Localize Leaderboards Into Contextual “Mini-Boards”**

Users compete best in meaningful contexts.

* Offer leaderboards by city, team, region, or topic.
* Allow friend-only or invite-only boards.
* Avoid overwhelming global contexts unless necessary.

---

## **9. Show Achievable Progress, Not the Entire Population**

Most users don’t need to see everyone—they need to see **what’s achievable**.

* Show **top players** for inspiration.
* Show **the user’s own rank** for grounding.
* Show **near-future achievable ranks**, e.g.:

  * “You need +12 points to reach Rank #28.”
* Do *not* display hundreds or thousands of irrelevant positions.
  This keeps focus on short-term, realistic progress.

---

# **Summary Checklist**

A leaderboard should help users clearly understand:

1. *Where they are*
2. *How they can progress*
3. *What small actions lead to the next win*
4. *Why the system is fair, transparent, and trustworthy*
