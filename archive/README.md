# Archive Folder

## Purpose

This folder contains **redundant and superseded documentation files** that have been consolidated into the main documentation guides.

## Why Archived?

As part of professional project organization (November 26, 2025), multiple overlapping documentation files were merged into three comprehensive guides:

1. **DESIGN-SYSTEM.md** (1,047 lines) — Complete design system
2. **RTL-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md** (850 lines) — Persian/RTL guide  
3. **PROJECT-GUIDE.md** (900 lines) — Project architecture

## What's Here

All files in this folder are **outdated** and have been superseded by the new documentation structure. They are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Backup purposes
- Audit trail

## Do Not Use

⚠️ **These files should NOT be used for reference**. Always refer to the current documentation in the `/docs/` folder.
